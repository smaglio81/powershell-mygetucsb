# powershell-mygetucsb
MyGetUcsb module for Powershell (out of date and not actively supported)

This module was developed to populate and set permissions on developer accounts in myget. It won't be maintained, but hopefully can use it to make something better later on.

See `Scripts/20180702-Populate-MyGet-Users.ps1` for the population script
